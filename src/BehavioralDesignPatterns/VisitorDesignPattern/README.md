**Visitor** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

-> Allows you to add methods to classes of different types without much altering to those classes.
-> You can make completely different methods depending on the class used.
-> Allows you to define external classes that can extend other classes without majorly editing them.
