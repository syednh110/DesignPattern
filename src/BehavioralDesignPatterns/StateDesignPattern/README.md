**State** is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

**Identification:** The State pattern can be recognized by methods that change their behavior depending on the objectsâ€™ state. You can confirm identification if you see that this state can be controlled or replaced by other objects, including state objects themselves.

**Usage examples:** The State pattern is commonly used in Java to convert massive switch-base state machines into objects.
